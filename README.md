### One-Liner

Mapping the historical annexation of land into the City of Oakland, California

### Background

This is a micro-project by [@daguar (Dave)](https://github.com/daguar/) and [@alanjosephwilliams (Alan)](https://github.com/alanjosephwilliams/). As Dave met up with Alan at the Oakland History Room of the Oakland Public Library, Alan mentioned that one of the librarians had just shown him a map she'd drawn (by hand) of the history of Oakland's annexation and growth. When Dave heard about this, he said, "(GeoJSON.io)[http://www.geojson.io]: Let's do this."

There was also the though that, hey, public librarians may well be a great target for some of the user-friendly web mapping tools that are becoming so prolific these days. This is in part a test-drive for this broader idea.

### How We Did It, Technically

We used the excellent free web geo editor, [GeoJSON.io](http://www.geojson.io), to digitally draw the shapes based on the Oakland Public Library's map. We then used [the official city boundary data from Alameda County](https://www.acgov.org/government/geospatial.htm) to place the actual current boundaries underneath.

We did partial commits of each shape (using GeoJSON.io to incrementally add) to create a history. This was inspired by [@tmcw's /the-united-states-of-america project](https://github.com/tmcw/the-united-states-of-america/commits).

### Data Quality and Caveats

This is a purely fun project in its first iteration and there is NO GUARANTEE that this data is precise at all. Use it at your own risk.
